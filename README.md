Simple Models of Two-Cell pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma (PING) Neurons

# 1.RTM & WB Cell PING
## Hodgkin-Huxley Model of an Inhibitory Interneuron in Rat Hippocampus.

To build intuition, we begin with a two-cell network, consisting of a single E- and a single I-cell, with E-to-I and I-to-E (but not E-to-E or I-to-I) connectivity. The E-cell is an RTM neuron, and the I-cell a WB neuron. Voltage traces resulting from a simulation of such a two-cell network are shown in Fig. 30.3; the parameter values are specified in the caption of the figure. (Note that we use the notation τd,E for the decay time constant of the excitatory synapse, and τd,I for that of the inhibitory synapse.) Each time the E-cell fires, the I-cell promptly responds.
